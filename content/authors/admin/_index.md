I am a teaching-focused Senior Lecturer and the Deputy Director Education for the [School of Psychology and Neuroscience](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/) at the University of Glasgow. I teach research methods, individual differences and #rstats, and am also Year Lead for our Level 1 undergraduate cohort. I am a vocal advocate of open science and open educational resources and strive to incorporate them into both my teaching and my research design. As a member of the [PsyTeachR](https://psyteachr.github.io/) team I have authored several open-access data skills books and tutorials.

My [research](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=-7Y95XAAAAAJ&hl=en) predominantly focuses on lecture capture, how it can be used as an effective study tool by students and the impact on students from widening participation backgrounds as well as those with disabilities and neurodivergent conditions. In all my work, I draw on theories of learning from cognitive science and self-regulation, as well as theories of belonging and self-efficacy.
