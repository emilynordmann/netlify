I am a teaching-focused Senior Lecturer and the Deputy Director Education for the [School of Psychology and Neuroscience](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/) at the University of Glasgow. I teach research methods, individual differences and #rstats, and am also Year Lead for our Level 1 undergraduate cohort. I am a vocal advocate of open science and open educational resources and strive to incorporate them into both my teaching and my research design. As a member of the [PsyTeachR](https://psyteachr.github.io/) team I have authored several open-access data skills books and tutorials, and I am also the Communications Chair of [EdArXiv](https://edarxiv.org/), the preprint sever for the education research community.

My [research](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=-7Y95XAAAAAJ&hl=en) predominantly focuses on the relationship between technology and learning, in particular, lecture capture and how it can be used as an effective study tool and the impact on students from widening participation backgrounds. Since the disruption of COVID-19, my work has pivoted to supporting staff and students with a transition to online learning and back again with a particular focus on how to foster belonging and generic study skills.
