<p>Dear Kathleen,</p>
<p>This is your thesis. As interpreted by a nerd.</p>
<p>Your thesis has 80613 words in total. Don’t freak out if this is different to something you wrote on an official form, R will count every word in every table and footnote. What matters is that it is 28613 words longer than your wife’s thesis.</p>

<p>In your thesis you used 12669 unique words and numbers. But which chapter had the highest proportion of unique words?</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Chapter 1 would win at Scrabble.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But what are all those words? Here are the top words used per chapter, excluding “stop words” which are common function words like “and”, “the”, “it”, etc.</p>

<p>If you’re so nerdily inclined, you can also look at bigrams, pairs of consecutive words (excluding stop words).</p>

<p>Honestly, I’m not completely sure that this graph is at all useful, but it looks nice doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Who doesn’t love a word cloud? Here’s your top 50 words of the entire thesis (excluding stop words).</p>

<p>What about the most positive and negative words?</p>

<p>Finally, because I love you, a pie chart.</p>
<p>LOOK HOW HARD IT IS TO READ.</p>
