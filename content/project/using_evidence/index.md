First year students typically quickly learn to base their essays and reports on appropriate sources of evidence. However, appropriate citation placement can take longer to develop. This activity is designed to help students understand where to use evidence when producing academic writing. Students are provided with passages from published papers that have the citations removed and they are asked to add them back in, requiring students to determine which statements require evidence. The download contains the student version of the activity, and the answer file.

You are free to reuse, remix and adapt these files without attribution, however, because even teaching-focused academics need to worry about impact, please let me know via e-mail or Twitter if you do!
