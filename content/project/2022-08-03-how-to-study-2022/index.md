This is the 2022 update to my How to Study lecture. This introductory lecture is given to first year students in week 1 of term. The main focus of the lecture is on developing effective study strategies and to demystify some of the hidden curriculum.

Topics covered include:

* How to take notes
* What to do before, during, and after lectures
* How to use lecture recordings
* How to send an e-mail
* Which study strategies are effective and which are not

The 2022 updates partially involve returning to some pre-covid wording about in-person lectures and lecture recordings, but also takes account of how our practice has changed following the lessons learned from the pivot to online. In particular, for my lectures, I intend to keep the structure I developed for my [watch parties](https://journal.aldinhe.ac.uk/index.php/jldhe/article/view/696), that is, I'm not returning to my original 50-minute lecture, I am keeping the chunks and the quizzes and the breaks.

You are free to reuse, remix and adapt these slides without attribution, however, like any academic I occasionally need to prove my worth, so please let me know via e-mail or Twitter if you do!


*The purpose of Open Educational Resources is to reduce unnecessary financial burden on students and to help share good practice. I make as many of my teaching materials open access as I can for these reasons, however, if you have found them helpful and are in a position to do so, please consider making a donation to [Black British Professionals in STEM](https://bbstem.co.uk/donations/) or [Pride in STEM](https://prideinstem.org/shop/) (currently by buying a badge).*
