This is a short tutorial on basic data visualisation in R covering scatterplots, boxplots, violin-plots, bar charts, and grouped data. It assumes basic R knowledge (e.g., how to run a function and load a package) but it does not assume any further programming ability.

This tutorial was the result of a request by for anti-racism curriculum materials. The data used is from the Slave Voyages project. The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database comprises 36,000 individual slaving expeditions between 1514 and 1866. This dataset is horrifying and so is the history contained within the graphs you will produce.
