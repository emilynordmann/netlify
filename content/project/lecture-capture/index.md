We have produced infographic guides to help students use lecture recordings effectively. These guides accompany the following paper which provides recommendations for both students and instructors and has been accepted for publication and is currently available as a pre-print:

> Nordmann, E., Kuepper-Tetzel, C. E., Robson, L., Phillipson, S., Lipan, G., & Mcgeorge, P. (accpeted). Lecture capture: Practical recommendations for students and instructors. *Scholarship of Teaching and Learning in Psychology. https://doi.org/0.1037/stl0000190

The guides are available in English, German, Dutch, and Welsh. You are free to reuse, remix and adapt these guides with attribution. Because even teaching-focused academics need to worry about impact, please let me know via e-mail or Twitter if you do adopt them!

*The purpose of Open Educational Resources is to reduce unnecessary financial burden on students and to help share good practice. I make as many of my teaching materials open access as I can for these reasons, however, if you have found them helpful and are in a position to do so, please consider making a donation to [Black British Professionals in STEM](https://bbstem.co.uk/donations/) or [Pride in STEM](https://prideinstem.org/shop/) (currently by buying a badge).*
