This introductory lecture is given to first year students in week 1 of term. The main focus of the lecture is on developing effective study strategies and to demystify some of the hidden curriculum.

Topics covered include:
* How to take notes  
* What to do before, during, and after lectures  
* How to use lecture recordings  
* How to send an e-mail
* Which study strategies are effective and which are not

You are free to reuse, remix and adapt these slides without attribution, however, because even teaching-focused academics need to worry about impact, please let me know via e-mail or Twitter if you do!

*The purpose of Open Educational Resources is to reduce unnecessary financial burden on students and to help share good practice. I make as many of my teaching materials open access as I can for these reasons, however, if you have found them helpful and are in a position to do so, please consider making a donation to [Black British Professionals in STEM](https://bbstem.co.uk/donations/) or [Pride in STEM](https://prideinstem.org/shop/) (currently by buying a badge).*
