The MSc data skills and statistics book is intended for MSc Conversion course psychology students who have no prior experience in programming or statistics and who come from incredibly varied academic backgrounds. The course covers intro to R, data wrangling, visualisation, and descriptive and inferential statistics (correlation, t-test, chi-square, ANOVA, regression, power and effect size), underpinned by a focus on reproducibility.
