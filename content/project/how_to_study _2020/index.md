This is an update of my How to Study lecture that has been adapted for the pivot to online learning. The changes include:

* Changing the section on attendance to keeping up 
* Adding a section about technology and environment
* Adding a slide on time management
* Adding info about open-book exams

You are free to reuse, remix and adapt these slides without attribution, however, because even teaching-focused academics need to worry about impact, please let me know via e-mail or Twitter if you do!

* [Download slides](https://osf.io/5kvfb/)

*The purpose of Open Educational Resources is to reduce unnecessary financial burden on students and to help share good practice. I make as many of my teaching materials open access as I can for these reasons, however, if you have found them helpful and are in a position to do so, please consider making a donation to [Black British Professionals in STEM](https://bbstem.co.uk/donations/) or [Pride in STEM](https://prideinstem.org/shop/) (currently by buying a badge).*
