    <div class="article-style">
      


<p>This is the second in a series of blog posts discussing how I’m using ChatGPT to create teaching materials (<a href="https://www.emilynordmann.com/post/using-chatgpt-to-create-teaching-materials-data-simulation-mcqs/">see here for part 1 on using it for data simulation and creating MCQs</a>). For technical context, I have primarily been using GPT4 through a paid subscription to ChatGPT but I also occasionally use Bing Chat on Creative mode (which uses GPT4 under the hood I believe).</p>
<p>For pedagogical context, I am course lead for a large (700 students) first year introductory psychology course. The main substantive piece of coursework students complete in the first semester is a 1500 word essay taking a critical approach to the history of psychology (the questions are focused on things like eugenics, the replication crisis, the pathologisation of LGBTQ people etc., I’ve written about the essay <a href="https://www.emilynordmann.com/project/missing_history/">here</a>).</p>
<p>For marking and feedback, we use Turnitin Feedback Studio. Students receive on-script comments, a general feedback comment, and then a rubric with a rating on six criteria from Excellent (A grade) to Very Poor (G). Our full marking scheme is on a 22-point scale. The rubric doesn’t calculate a score, but the grade and the rubric should align and the marker uses the rubric to help decide the grade, i.e., if the rubric is majority Very Goods, they should be getting some sort of B.</p>
<p><img src="images/scheduleA.png" width="200" height="200" /></p>
<p>Importantly, the rubric contains descriptions of what each level of attainment should look like. Part of the reason we include a rubric is to provide students with clear assessment criteria before submission, and clear feedback after, but part of the reason is also to help maintain consistency between markers. With 700 students, we have 10-11 markers on the team and using rubrics really helps with alignment. We also use a shared QuickMark comment bank and have multiple marking alignment meetings although that’s not relevant to the current blog.</p>
<p><img src="images/rubric.png" /></p>
<p>But, writing good rubric descriptors is HARD. Getting the balance between the descriptors being specific enough to be useful to students but leaving a little room for pragmatism for markers is incredibly difficult. For example, one year, one of the rubric descriptors allowed no errors in spelling, punctuation or grammar. This seems like an entirely sensible thing to expect of an excellent essay for the writing communication criteria but if you follow it exactly (which is what you want your markers to be able to do for consistency), you end up marking down the best essay you’d ever read if it had a single typo or missing comma, which is stupid. Additionally, I particularly struggle writing the descriptions at the lower end of the criteria (is it just me?) - how do you usefully distinguish “Poor” from “Very poor”? It’s part of our marking scheme so we can and we must but putting it into words takes some effort.</p>
<div id="marking-criteria" class="section level2">
<h2>Marking criteria</h2>
<p>So, enter ChatGPT. The first thing I did was to see if it could improve the six marking criteria we use. Throughout all assessments on our programme, we group assessment criteria into knowledge &amp; research, evaluation &amp; analysis, and communication so I knew that I needed to keep this grouping.</p>
<p>My first prompt was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Act as an expert psychology lecturer. Write marking criteria that could be used to assess the below essay questions. There should be six criteria, two about knowledge and research, two about analysis and evaluation and use of evidence, and two about academic communication. Present these in a table. [followed by essay questions]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For comparison, I present the marking criteria ChatGPT created with this relatively simple prompt, and the criteria that we used in 2022, the ones I wrote myself with my muggle brain.</p>
<p><em>Well bugger me</em>.</p>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Knowledge and Research</td>
<td>Understanding of the topic, including relevant theories, concepts, historical context, and methodological approaches. This should be demonstrated by a comprehensive discussion of key ideas, appropriate use of terminology, and an accurate representation of relevant research findings and studies.</td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Knowledge and Research</td>
<td>Quality and breadth of research sources, including primary research articles, review articles, and/or reputable secondary sources. The essay should demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the field by referring to a diverse range of sources, and these sources should be current and relevant to the topic.</td>
<td>Use a range of relevant academic sources upon which to base the essay</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Analysis and Evaluation/Use of Evidence</td>
<td>Capacity to critically evaluate and analyze the evidence, considering strengths, limitations, implications, and alternative viewpoints. The essay should demonstrate an ability to think independently, and to connect and contrast different pieces of evidence in a thoughtful and meaningful way.</td>
<td>Provide analysis, interpretation, and evaluation of the evidence presented to answer the specific question asked.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Analysis and Evaluation/Use of Evidence</td>
<td>Use of empirical evidence to support arguments. Each argument should be substantiated by empirical findings from relevant research, with appropriate citation. The essay should integrate evidence in a way that supports and enhances the overall argument, rather than simply describing individual studies.</td>
<td>Use academic evidence to support your analysis, interpretation, and evaluation</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Academic communication</td>
<td>Clarity and organization of the essay. The essay should have a clear structure (introduction, body, conclusion), with coherent and logically-structured paragraphs. The flow of argument should be easy to follow, and transitions between points and sections should be smooth.</td>
<td>Ensure that the essay has a logical structure and that the paragraphs flow together to form a coherent narrative.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Academic communication</td>
<td>Quality of writing, including grammar, punctuation, and referencing. The essay should be well-written, with clear and concise language. It should be free of spelling and grammatical errors, and it should adhere to the appropriate academic referencing style (e.g., APA, MLA).</td>
<td>Write clearly and succinctly with appropriate use of spelling, grammar, and APA referencing.</td>
</tr>

</table>
<p>To make myself feel better I must highlight that the fuller criteria ChatGPT has produced essentially include the “Excellent” descriptor from the rubric, whereas mine are just the headline criteria. But wow, that’s pretty close.</p>
</div>
<div id="rubrics" class="section level2">
<h2>Rubrics</h2>
<p>I then followed this up with a request for the rubric descriptors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now write me rubric descriptions for each of these criteria. There should be a description for excellent, very good, good, satisfactory, weak, poor and very poor. Present these in a table.</p>

<h2>Evaluation, limitations, and considerations</h2>
<p>Ok, with less melodrama, let’s be critical about what it’s produced. It’s definitely not perfect and could not be used out the box without an editor with expertise. Its first attempt has recreated the issue I had previously of requiring perfection for an “Excellent” rating on “Quality of writing”. Again, you’d think it’s a sensible thing to suggest but such is the value of experience. There’s also a bit of an issue specific to our essay questions in that because they cover the history of psychology, the sources necessarily will not all be current. Another sensible suggestion but this needs edited to stop it causing confusion and anxiety.</p>
<p>I could edit these manually or I could try to use ChatGPT to shape its responses further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rewrite quality of writing but don’t specify an exact number of errors that are allowed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s better. Let’s try fixing the other issue:</p>

<p>It’s better but I still don’t like it as the balance of historical and current sources that’s right will depend on the essay question they answer. It feels unlikely I’ll get it to get this one right and will edit it myself.</p>
<p>But, as a base from which to start editing this is incredibly helpful. There’s loads of rubric examples out there but the beauty of using ChatGPT is that I’ve been able to shape these examples to make the starting point more relevant to me by giving it the essay questions, the number of criteria I want, and the categories to group them into.</p>
<p>As with my attempts to use it for <a href="https://www.emilynordmann.com/post/using-chatgpt-to-create-teaching-materials-data-simulation-mcqs/">data simulation and writing MCQs</a>, I’ve simplified the process I underwent here. I used the regenerate option quite a few times and some of them were better than others. The final rubric I use next year is going to be a combination of bits of the old rubric I wrote myself that were working well, along with some edited adaptions from several versions ChatGPT produced, and I’m also going to ask the teaching team to review it before we release it to students.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the point I made in my first blog post about using ChatGPT for teaching which is that I simply don’t see how any of this would be possible or useful without prior expertise and experience.</p>
<p>I’m really glad that I’ve started using it for my own work because it’s given me an insight into how students might use it for assessments and the potential repercussions. Very quickly my focus has changed from “how do we stop them from using it?” or “how do we spot if they’re using it?” to “how do we make sure they first get the prior knowledge and experience they need to use it effectively?”. And not just students, everyone, everywhere, working on any task. In some ways I feel incredibly lucky that this has appeared at this point in my career when have built up the expertise and experience to use it to facilitate my work, whilst being knowledgeable enough to know when not to follow it and to ensure my work never loses my voice and my steer.</p>
<p>Without that prior knowledge and experience guiding me, my overwhelming sense is that everything it produces would look great on the surface but would just be <em>a little bit shit</em> once you started looking at it properly.</p>
<p>How do we convince people of this when they have access to these tools at the start of their journey? No, really, I’m asking, because I don’t think I (or anyone else) know the answer yet.</p>
