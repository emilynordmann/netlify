      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an update of my How to Study lecture that has been adapted for the pivot to online learning. The changes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing the section on attendance to keeping up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a section about technology and environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a slide on time management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding info about open-book exams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are free to reuse, remix and adapt these slides without attribution, however, because even teaching-focused academics need to worry about impact, please let me know via e-mail or Twitter if you do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/5kvfb/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Download slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The purpose of Open Educational Resources is to reduce unnecessary financial burden on students and to help share good practice. I make as many of my teaching materials open access as I can for these reasons, however, if you have found them helpful and are in a position to do so, please consider making a donation to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://bbstem.co.uk/donations/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Black British Professionals in STEM&lt;/a&gt; or

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have produced infographic guides to help students use lecture recordings effectively. These guides accompany the following paper which provides recommendations for both students and instructors and has been accepted for publication and is currently available as a pre-print:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This introductory lecture is given to first year students in week 1 of term. The main focus of the lecture is on developing effective study strategies and to demystify some of the hidden curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics covered include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to take notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to do before, during, and after lectures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use lecture recordings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to send an e-mail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which study strategies are effective and which are not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are free to reuse, remix and adapt these slides without attribution, however, because even teaching-focused academics need to worry about impact, please let me know via e-mail or Twitter if you do!&lt;/p&gt;
