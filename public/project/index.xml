      <title>Slave Voyages Data Visualisation</title>
      <link>/project/slave-voyages/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/slave-voyages/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a short tutorial on basic data visualisation in R covering scatterplots, boxplots, violin-plots, bar charts, and grouped data. It assumes basic R knowledge (e.g., how to run a function and load a package) but it does not assume any further programming ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial was the result of a request by for anti-racism curriculum materials. The data used is from the Slave Voyages project. The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database comprises 36,000 individual slaving expeditions between 1514 and 1866. This dataset is horrifying and so is the history contained within the graphs you will produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is part of the

      <title>How to Study</title>
      <link>/project/how_to_study/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/how_to_study/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This introductory lecture is given to first year students in week 1 of term. The main focus of the lecture is on developing effective study strategies and to demystify some of the hidden curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics covered include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to take notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to do before, during, and after lectures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use lecture recordings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to send an e-mail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which study strategies are effective and which are not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are free to reuse, remix and adapt these slides without attribution, however, because even teaching-focused academics need to worry about impact, please let me know via e-mail or Twitter if you do!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The MSc data skills and statistics book is intended for MSc Conversion course psychology students who have no prior experience in programming or statistics and who come from incredibly varied academic backgrounds.

      <title>Using Evidence</title>
      <link>/project/using_evidence/</link>

      <guid>/project/using_evidence/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First year students typically quickly learn to base their essays and reports on appropriate sources of evidence. However, appropriate citation placement can take longer to develop. This activity is designed to help students understand where to use evidence when producing academic writing. Students are provided with passages from published papers that have the citations removed and they are asked to add them back in, requiring students to determine which statements require evidence. The download contains the student version of the activity, and the answer file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are free to reuse, remix and adapt these files without attribution, however, because even teaching-focused academics need to worry about impact, please let me know via e-mail or Twitter if you do!&lt;/p&gt;
