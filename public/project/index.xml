      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an update of my How to Study lecture that has been adapted for the pivot to online learning. The changes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing the section on attendance to keeping up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a section about technology and environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a slide on time management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding info about open-book exams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>The Missing History of Psychology</title>
      <link>/project/missing_history/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/missing_history/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like to think of myself as fairly good when it comes to inclusive practice, but the Black Lives Matter movement forced me to reflect on what I am doing beyond LGBTQ inclusivity and I came up short. In particular, I had to confront the fact that as the person who gives the history of psychology lecture to 1st years what I was giving them was largely the history of white Western men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still in the process of updating my lecture but I also wanted to rework the essay to give students the opportunity to take a more critical look at the history of psychology that is usually presented in class and in their textbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/aussieweegie&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Chiara Horlin&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/PatersonHelena&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Helena Paterson&lt;/a&gt;, and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/wtoivo1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wil Toivo&lt;/a&gt; from UofG Psychology for their input and advice on the questions and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full essay details are available below, but here&amp;rsquo;s the summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of psychology is often presented as a list of facts, figures, and names; a chronological timeline of the progression of our field and the notable events and people that have shaped what we know as psychology in the present day. Such timelines can give the impression that the history presented is objective and apolitical, that it is merely the account of one thing after another as it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, no history of any field could ever be complete - even in a relatively young field such as psychology, there&amp;rsquo;s simply too much to cover. What makes history subjective, political, and so often biased, lies in the facts, figures, and names we choose to include, and those we let fall by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broad topic of your essay is the missing history of psychology. Your task is to read Chapter 1 of the textbook (which is also on the essential reading list for RM lecture 2) and reflect on what isn&amp;rsquo;t covered. You will choose one question focused on one of the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Race&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gender identity and/or sexual orientation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Women in psychology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The replication crisis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychology and government policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Slave Voyages Data Visualisation</title>
      <link>/project/slave-voyages/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/slave-voyages/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a short tutorial on basic data visualisation in R covering scatterplots, boxplots, violin-plots, bar charts, and grouped data. It assumes basic R knowledge (e.g., how to run a function and load a package) but it does not assume any further programming ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial was the result of a request by for anti-racism curriculum materials. The data used is from the Slave Voyages project. The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database comprises 36,000 individual slaving expeditions between 1514 and 1866. This dataset is horrifying and so is the history contained within the graphs you will produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is part of the

      <title>Using Evidence</title>
      <link>/project/using_evidence/</link>

      <guid>/project/using_evidence/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First year students typically quickly learn to base their essays and reports on appropriate sources of evidence. However, appropriate citation placement can take longer to develop. This activity is designed to help students understand where to use evidence when producing academic writing. Students are provided with passages from published papers that have the citations removed and they are asked to add them back in, requiring students to determine which statements require evidence. The download contains the student version of the activity, and the answer file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are free to reuse, remix and adapt these files without attribution, however, because even teaching-focused academics need to worry about impact, please let me know via e-mail or Twitter if you do!&lt;/p&gt;
